MonomeSerial

A library for direct communication with a monome device via a serial connection.

Note:
  - This library has only been tested on OS X - any patches (with accompanying specs) for other OSs are welcome.
  - The library is also currently hardcoded to run against Ruby 1.9.1. If this is an issue for you, and you are
    willing to submit specced patches for other interpreters then these are also welcome.

Dependencies:
  - Ruby 1.9.1
  - activesupport
  - fcntl

* Make sure you have the ftdi drivers installed for your OS

* Plug in your monome

* Try the example toggle app: ruby examples/toggler.rb
